# Data Science In my own Words

# Data Science
Data can be basically anything that a human can comprehend and analyze. It can be about economics , daily life, politics entertainment and anything you can think of. And data science is a science which works on giving a meaning to the data by analyzing it . I personally love sports data especially football and basketball data. Because with data science we can make predictions and analyze the sports in a better way. For example we can predict how much points Kevin Durant might score in his next match or we can try to find when Manchester city will be defeated by a 4 goal deficit. We can obviously calculate the possibility of theses events using data, scoring averages for Kevin Durant and The game scores for manchester city is all we need.

# Importance of Statistics
 Statistics is a very powerfull way we can analyze data . Using some statistics we can make our own hypothesis with the help of relevant data. Using maths we can see if the hypothesis makes some sense or not. Using statistics and data we can predict if Kevin Durant is likely to score 30 points in his next match or not. What I am trying to say here is data science cannot be complete without the usage of statistics and maths.
